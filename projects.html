        <p>
          This was the first assignment for CS 1501 at the University Of Pittsburgh.
          In this project I was tasked with creating a alphabet of characters using
          an input of dictionary words and then manipulating the dictionary to find
          the frequency of certain character, checking if an input is a subsequence in the
          dictionary, as well as much more. We were tasked with completing this task in a
          space efficient and time efficient manner. This was a challeging project for me and
          allowed for me to get used to various advanced coding techniques that I will use
          in the future.

          This was the final project for CMPINF 10 at the University Of Pittsburgh.
          For this project my group and I were tasked with choosing 4 metrics and
          then using those metrics to decide upon the "best" Neighborhood in
          Pittsburgh. Using the metrics of employee counts, enrollment rates, household
          incomes, and park counts we found that South Side Flats was
          the best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh which was quite surprising.

        <p>
          I have always wanted to create a website, however I never had a good
          enough reason to dedicate a good majority of my time towards learning
          html, CSS, and JavaScript. While enrolled in ENGCMP 610 we were given a open
          ended project to Create something digital. I jumped on this opportunity
          and started to create my very first website and all the coding envolved. Through this project
          I gained a large understanding of the practices involved in website creation and the
          coding techniques I have previously used that carry over.

          This is the storyboard that I created in ENGCMP 610 during our Digital Mapping Workshop.
          Using GoogleMaps and ArcGIS we learned about creating Storyboards and creating a page
          that looks visually pleasing to the end user. I would later apply the skills learned
          in this workshop in my personal portfolio website.

        <p>
          This is the captioning assignment that I created for ENGCMP 610. In this project
          I captioned the sounds played during a short video clip. I visualized the background music,
          character voices, and the sound effects played throughout the clip. I learned through this that
          the captioning on videos can include a multitude of sounds or queues. To create
          adequate captions the intended audience must be recognized so they are able to gather the
          required information from the captions.
