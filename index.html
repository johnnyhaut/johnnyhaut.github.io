          I'm a Junior at Pitt and I'm working on getting my Bachelors Degree
          in <b>Computer Science</b>. So far I have really enjoyed my courses and I can't
          wait to apply my knowledge in building games and websites in the future. I'm 
          hoping to continue to work with the University of Pittsburgh and hopefully one 
          day have a position that is focused around computer programming.

        The Pittsburgh Steelers are my favorite football team and
        I watch them play every week! This year I'm trying to go to every
        home game and it has been a ton of fun. So far I have only witnessed one loss 
        in person and I hope that it doesn't happen again. With the firing of Matt Canada, 
        their previous Offensive Coordinator the Steeler's have more of a chance than ever to win it all!

        <p>
        As a computer Scientist I have experience in multiple coding languages; languages such as Python, 
        Java, HTML, CSS, along with mips Assembly. These coding skills have allowed
        for me to grow and gain hands on experience with varius platforms. At the 
        University of Pittsburgh I have taken numerous programming courses that have 
        focused on Python, Java, and Mips Assembly. These courses have strengthened my knowledge 
        of proper code formatting and coding practices. These skills have allowed for me to prosper 
        as a student at the University of Pittsburgh.

          At this position I was a help desk technician for the 24/7 help desk at
          the University of Pittsburgh. I would accept calls for user's associated 
          with the University Of Pittsburgh throughout all branch campuses and help resolve
          their technical issues. This would range from a simple password reset to a widespread 
          network outage where I would need to inform the correct department so the issue could 
          be resolved.
