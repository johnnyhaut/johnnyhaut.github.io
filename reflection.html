          This project was a fun way to learn about the fundamentals of website 
          creation as well as how every website we use daily works. Throughout the 
          creation of my website, I dealt with many setbacks, but I was able to persevere 
          and create a fully functional website that is pleasing to the eye. I choose to 
          create a website for my project as I am always browsing the web and as a Computer 
          Scientist, I have always wondered about how websites work and more specifically 
          how they are created. To create my first website, I first did preliminary research 
          about how websites work, so that I had a better understanding of issues(bugs) faced 
          with my website during the actual creation. I followed along with the resources provided 
          by <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">The Odin Project</a> as this was 
          recommended by a friend that is already a full-stack website developer and doing so 
          was a massive help. Using these resources, I then dove into the deep end of website 
          creation and created my first .html file. I started with just a title and description, 
          but then built my way up to having a header, footer, and images to bring life to my page. 
          When starting my website, I wanted to have flowing links that would direct the end user 
          across my website to different sections smoothly without just “snapping” to different 
          areas of my website. I was successful with this and created a site where all my internal 
          links’ transition seamlessly throughout my website. Another area that I hoped to 
          incorporate into my website was to try and make the website look appropriate on 
          different sized devices (laptops, tablets, phones, etc.). This would be done using 
          media queries; however, I was not able to successfully incorporate these into my 
          website before the due date. When first attempting to implement media queries I had 
          success, but it ended up breaking my website when adding more features. 
          For my final project I disabled these features as they were doing more harm than good.To create my 
          website I used 4 html files, 1 css file, and a bunch of images. I created three seperate
          pages that can be accessed from the navigation bar at the top of the screen: Index.html (JOHN logo), Projects.html(PROJECTS),
          and Reflection.html(REFLECTION). These house the majority of my website, however I also snuck another page
          containing my current and previous courses in the footer under College Career, Courses.html(Classes). Having 
          this variety in my website allowed for a more open feel where not everything was forced onto the same page. 
          I was extremelly pleased once I started seperating the pages like this and I am happy with the end result. 
          While I wasn’t able to incorporate everything I initially planned to do into
          my website, I hope to continue progressing my website with future accomplishments 
          and projects and when updating my website in the future I hope that I can 
          have it working good on all devices.
